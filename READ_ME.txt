Special Instructions: 

Adding and deleting rooms/appliances:
Before you can add any appliances to your room, you have to create a room first by clicking on the "Add room" button. 
The button to the right of "Add room" allows the user to select the appliance type to be added to any room. 
Left clicking an existing room creates a popup window to add an appliance (of the chosen type from the choicebox) to the room. 

Right clicking a room deletes a room along with its appliances, but not before a confirmation. 
Right clicking an appliance deletes it from that room, but not before a confirmation.

UI for each appliance: 
Left click any of the appliance you have already setup to enter a new user interface window for that appliance type. 
Any changes made before exiting the window for that appliance's UI will be saved, and the user will be returned to the home screen. 
When you leave and click back into the same appliance later, you will see that your settings will be as you left them.
